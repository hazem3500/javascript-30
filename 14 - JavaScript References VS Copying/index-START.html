    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // console.log(team, players);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'lux';

    // console.log(team, players);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // or use Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'oz prince',
      age: 42
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const magikchan = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const magikchan2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 2 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const magikchan3 = { ...person, power: 99999 };

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Oz',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@OzTheBoss',
        facebook: 'Oz.developer'
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // deepClone (poor man technique)
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
